# UpsilonLabs
Here I am collecting some of the code that was written as part of a project I did with Upsilon Labs at UCLA. I was on the **Modeling Quantum Systems with Machine Learning** Team where our goal was to write a machine learning algorithm that could solve the Shrodinger Equation for a particle in a user generated potential function. This project consisted of the machine learning side as well as coding a numerical solution to the Shrodinger Equation (using the Numerov Method) as a way to generate a test set for the machine learning algorithm. The test sets 'ian_Potentials.txt' and 'ian_wavefunctions.txt' were generated using the numerical solution code. This was part of a project with an organization at UCLA where our code is open source.
